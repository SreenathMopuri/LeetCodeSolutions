## [leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

## Solution: Sliding Window
Time : O(N), Space:O(1)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestOnes(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int windowStart = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;
        int maxOnesCount = 0;
        
        // Try to extend the range [windowStart, windowEnd]
        for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < nums.size(); windowEnd++) {
            if (nums[windowEnd] == 1) {
                maxOnesCount++;
            }
            
            // current Window size is from windowStart to windowEnd, overall we have a 
            // maximum of `1`s repeating maxOnesCount times, this means we can have a window
            // with maxOnesCount `1`s and the remaining are `0`s which should replace with `1`s
            // now, if the remaining `0`s are more than k, it is the time to shrink the 
            // window as we are not allowed to replace more than k `0`s
            if ((windowEnd - windowStart + 1 - maxOnesCount) > k) {
                if (nums[windowStart] == 1)
                    maxOnesCount--;
                windowStart++;
            }
            maxLength = max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
