# 62. Unique Paths
[Leetcode 62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## Approach 1 : Recursive
At each point, the robot has two ways of moving: right or down. Let P(m,n) is the wanted result. Then you have a recursive relationship:
```plain
P(m,n) = P(m-1, n) + P(m, n-1)
```
If the grid has only one row or only one column, then there is only one possible path.
```plain
P(1, n) = P(m, 1) = 1.
```
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    if (m == 1 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return uniquePaths(m - 1, n) + uniquePaths(m, n - 1);
}
```
### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(2^m + 2^n)`, where `m*n` is the size of the grid.
* Extra space: `O(2^m + 2^n)`.

## Approach 2 : Dynamic Programming
The recursive implementation repeats a lot of computations.

For example, `uniquePaths(2,2)` was recomputed in both `uniquePaths(2,3)` and `uniquePaths(3,2)` when you compute `uniquePaths(3,3)`.

One way of storing what has been computed is by using dynamic programming.

```cpp
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    vector<vector<int> > dp(m, vector<int>(n,1));
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        }
    }
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
}
```
### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(m*n)`, where `m*n` is the size of the grid.
* Extra space: `O(m*n)`.

## Approach 3: Optimized dynamic programming
You can rephrase the relationship inside the loop like this:
```plain
"new value" = "old value" + "previous value";
```
Then you do not have to store all values of all rows.
```cpp
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n - 1];
}
```
### Complexity
* Runtime `O(m*n)`.
* Memory `O(n)`.
