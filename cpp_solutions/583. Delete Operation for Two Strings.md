# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings
[Leetcode 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)

## Solution : Using LCS
The `prerequisite` for this problem is `Longest Common Subsequence. (LCS)`

To find the the `minimum` number of `steps` required to make `word1` and `word2` the same.
The `minimumnumber` of steps= `length of s1 + length of s2 - 2 length of LCS`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size();
        int n = word2.size();
        
        vector<int> lcs(n+1, 0);
        int curr, prev;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            prev = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                curr = lcs[j];
                lcs[j] = max({lcs[j], lcs[j - 1], prev + (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1])});
                prev = curr;
            }
        }
        return (m + n) - 2 * lcs[n];
    }
};
```

### Complexity
* Time : `O(M * N)`
* Space : `O(N)`
