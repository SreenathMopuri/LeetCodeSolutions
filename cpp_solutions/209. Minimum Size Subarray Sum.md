# 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

[leetcode - 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

## Approach 1 : Sliding window 
Time : O(N), Space:O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        // sliding window, BUT the window size is not fixed
        int windowSum = 0;
        int minLength = INT_MAX;
        int windowStart = 0;
        
        // First, we will add-up elements from the beggining of the array
        for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < nums.size(); windowEnd++) {
            // add the next element
            windowSum += nums[windowEnd];
            
            // shrink the window as small as possible until windowSum is small
            while (windowSum >= target) {
                // These elements will constitute our sliding window. We are asked to find the
                // smallest such window after this, we will keep adding one element in the sliding window
                minLength = min(minLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
                
                // Substract the first element of the window from the running sum to shrink the sliding window
                windowSum -= nums[windowStart];
                windowStart++;
            }
        }
        return minLength == INT_MAX ? 0 : minLength;
    }
};
